# Python Portfolio
This is a some python code I have written over the years, content includes:
- **4256** - Code written for CSE 4256 class (contains NumPy and basic algorithms)
- **Makeathon2025SignLanguage** - see Main.py (function.py was hand-tracking library we found). Code takes hand sign language input, translates it with google translate API, and outputs text to arduino and spoken audio file. Project won 2nd place at MakeOHI/O2025 (video submitted: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15qjVCR3XxTKg9d7XZYEIiE9ti1WFwkla/view)
- **ProjectEuler** - Fun programming/math problems I like to do (similar to leetcode), I attached a couple solutions I did using python, for more information of the site, go https://projecteuler.net/about
- **Quantathon2025NN** - Tensorflow Neural Network trained on provided csv files to predict stock market trends for SIAM2I Quantathon 2025. (video submitted https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4N3RjLH-XjKPAP8to0RS05v47MpgV1W/view)
